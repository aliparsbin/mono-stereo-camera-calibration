# Camera Calibration

The aim of the camera calibration is to find the **Intrinsic and Extrinsic Parameters** for the camera to remove the *distortion* in images. 

## Mono Camera Calibration

1. Extrinsic Parameters: corresponds to rotation and translation vectors which translate the coordinates of a 3D point to a coordinate system.
2. Intrinsic Parameters: they include information like focal length `(fx, fy)` and optical centers `(cx, cy)`.
   The focal length and optical centers can be used to create a camera matrix, which can be used to remove distortion due to the lenses of a specific camera.
   The camera matrix is unique to a specific camera, so once calculated, it can be reused on other images taken by the same camera. It is expressed as a 3x3 matrix:

How to experiment: We find some specific points of which we already know the relative positions (e.g., square corners in the chess board). 
We know the coordinates of these points in real-world space, and we know the coordinates in the image, so we can solve for the distortion coefficients. 
For better results, we need at least `10` test patterns.
